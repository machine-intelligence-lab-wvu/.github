## :computer: What we do 
We are a group of curious researchers dedicated to understanding machine intelligence, with a focus on building intelligent models that generalize effectively and are reliable. To achieve this, we study a wide array of deep learning topics, 
including foundation models, survival analysis, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.
Our research extends into critical domains, such as healthcare and material science, where these models can have significant impact. 
Through these efforts, we aim to push the boundaries of what machine intelligence can achieve in solving real-world problems.
